// Copy constructors:
//  Copy one object into another
// Move constructors:
//  Move the object into this one, the old object is no longer valid
//  Move constructors are optional, if you donâ€™t provide it then the 
//  copy constructor will be called.
//  A concept of moving ownership, the data stays in the same place on 
//  the heap, however the old object can no longer reference it, the new 
//  object owns this reference.

// The only difference between a copy constructor and a move constructor 
// is whether the source object that is passed to the constructor will 
// have its member fields copied or moved into the new object.

// Imagine an object containing a member pointer to some data that is 
// elsewhere in memory.

// A copy constructor must leave the source object intact, so it must 
// allocate its own copy of the object's data for itself. Both objects 
// now refer to different copies of the same data in different areas of 
// memory 

// A move constructor, on the other hand, can simply "move" the data by 
// taking ownership of the pointer that refers to the data, leaving the 
// data itself where it resides. The new object now points at the original 
// data, and the source object is modified to no longer point at the data. 
// The data itself is left untouched.
